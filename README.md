# Windows-Virus
This virus deletes registry files on your computer which will require you to reinstall Windows (if you can manage to save your device). I am not responsible for damage caused by this code. 

To enable the code, copy and paste it into Notepad and then save it as as whatever you want with .bat at the end. Be careful with opening the file. To open it without completely destroying your device right-click on the file and click "Edit". 

If you want to disable the option of going around the virus explained above, download a file converter. Next you want to convert the .bat file into an .exe file and save it. Don't use this code on yourself unless you're dumb.

Enjoy :)
